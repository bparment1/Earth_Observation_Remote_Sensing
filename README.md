# Earth_Observation_Remote_Sensing

It's an exciting time to learn about Earth Observation and Remote Sensing. As more and more satellites are launched to observe the Earth surface, understanding how to access, download and analyze Earth Observation dataset becomes crucial for researcher, scientists, data scientist and engineer alike. This repo is structured as an introductory course on using satellite imagery for a variety of applications. We provide hands-on example leveraging python and geospatial libraries such as gdal/ogr, rasterio, geopandas, xarray and many more open source libraries.

Exercies follow a sequence but you can start anywhere you might like:

1. Intro to Remote Sensing
2. STAC intro: searching for earth imagery
3. Downloading and processing data using STAC, GDAL and rasterio: Sentinel 2 use case
4. Visualizing images with rasterio and xarray
5. Quality and pixel masking:  Sentinel 2 use case
6. Monitoring flooding with Time series Sentinel 2, GDAL and rasterio
7. Monitoring flooding with Time series Sentinel 2, xarray
8. Scaling with dask xarray intro 
9. Flood mapping with Sentinel 1
